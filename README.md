AgroEdge AI: Your Conversational Farm Assistant
A Frontend Prototype of a Smart Farming Companion

AgroEdge AI is a single-page, frontend-only application designed to showcase a "lovable AI" user experience. This project simulates a smart farming assistant that communicates proactively and naturally with users through a conversational interface. By focusing on a clean and intuitive user flow built with TypeScript and CSS, this prototype demonstrates the core concept without relying on a backend or a database.

All sensor data, alerts, and AI responses are mocked within the application's state to provide a realistic and interactive demonstration of the user interface and conversational logic.

‚ú® Features
Conversational Data Dashboard: Simulates real-time farm data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature) through a dynamic chat bubble interface. The AI assistant provides a human-like summary of the data and offers simple, actionable advice.

Empathetic Diagnostic Tool: A UI flow that allows users to "upload" a picture of a sick plant. The application provides a mocked, empathetic response and a simulated diagnosis to showcase the interaction.

Proactive & Contextual Alerts: The application uses timers to trigger pre-scripted, conversational alerts, demonstrating how the AI can proactively offer help based on simulated conditions.

Seamless Expert Handoff: A simulated UI that shows the process of handing a conversation off to a human expert, complete with a confirmation message from the AI.

üíª Technology Stack
Frontend:

React: The core library for building the single-page application.

TypeScript: For building a robust, type-safe application that is easier to maintain and scale.

CSS: For all styling, ensuring a clean and professional design.
